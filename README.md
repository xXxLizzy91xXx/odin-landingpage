# The Odin Project- Landing Page Assignment

## Project Description
For my project I will be creating a landing page with HTML and CSS. 
This is to show off the skills I am currently learning through The Odin Project

## End Goal
This project is set from the Odin Project so they have provided an end goal for me to reach. This picture shows what I am aiming to create using my knowledge of HTML and CSS, the project at the moment will not be compatible for mobile devices, in the future as I gain further knowledge I will adapt the project to be accessible to all devices
